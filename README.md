# ‚öíÔ∏è Productive API

üìå **Productive API** is a **powerful and secure backend solution** for managing team tasks, collaboration, and productivity. It offers **seamless user roles, real-time task management, and secure authentication** ‚Äî all built with industry-best practices. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üå† Features

- üï∏Ô∏è 22 API Endpoints
- ü§ù RESTful Architecture
- üë∑ Well-structured **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for 4 levels of privilege - **Viewer, Commenter, Editor and Admin**
- üîç Advanced filters (`finished`, `createdBy`, `assignedTo`, `sortBy`, `priority`, `deadline`, etc.) to prevent over-fetching
- üè∑Ô∏è Segregate tasks into **tags (similar to boards)** for subteams
- üí¨ **Commenting system** to start conversations under tasks
- ‚õî **JWT Authentication** for Protected Routes
- üîí Secure **hashing + salting** of passwords using [bcryptjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- üö¶ Sensible **rate limits** on critical endpoints to prevent abuse
- üîÅ Security-enhancing middleware like [cors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors), [xss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xss) and [express-mongo-sanitize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-mongo-sanitize)
- ‚öôÔ∏è Modular and easy to configure source code for every endpoint
- üå± Easy to **self-host** in just a **few steps** (described below)

## ü™£ Dependencies

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) on your system

2. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) on your system

3. You can use any tool of your choice, such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to interact with the API.

## üß± Building from Source

1. First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranavcl/productive-api
```

2. Enter the cloned repository and run `npm install`:

```bash
cd productive-api
npm install
```

3. Make sure `npx` is installed:

```bash
npm install --global npx
```

4. Create a `.env` file in the **root directory (./productive-api)** and define the values of **`KEY` (mandatory)** and **`BASE_URL`, `PORT` and `DB` (optional)** like so:

```
KEY=your-secret-key

BASE_URL=http://localhost:2000/
PORT=2000
DB=mongodb://localhost:27017/productive
```

5. **(Optional)** Additionally, If you want the **/auth/forgot-password** and **/auth/reset-password** endpoints to work, you must also define the environment variables **`EMAILHOST`, `SSLPORT`, `EMAILUSER` and `EMAILPASS`** in your `.env` file like so:

```
EMAILHOST=smtp.yourdomain.com
SSLPORT=465 (or whatever the SSL port is on your mailserver)
EMAILUSER=example@yourdomain.com
EMAILPASS=(your email account's password)
```

6. Finally, run the API using `nodemon`:

```
npx nodemon
```

**All done!** üéâ

## üó∫Ô∏è Summary of Endpoints

### üö® <ins>Note:</ins> 

- An **exclamation mark (!)** denotes a **required** field.
- The hierarchy of privilege is **Viewer -> Commenter -> Editor -> Admin**.
- **Commenter+** means any role that is **Commenter or above (Editor, Admin)** can hit the endpoint successfully. Similarly, **Editor+** means any role that is **Editor or above (Admin)** can hit the endpoint successfully.
- **(None)** means that the endpoint can be hit without a role (without logging in).
- The JWT should be included in the **`Authorization` header** of the HTTP request as follows:
```makefile
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```
*(Make sure there is a space between "`Bearer`" and the token.)*
